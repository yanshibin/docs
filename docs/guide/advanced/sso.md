# Third-party single sign-on
### **Single sign-on client id**

client ID

### **Single sign-on client secrets**

secrets ID



::: warning matters needing attention

1. Remember to write and save the background parameters of AList. After writing and saving, you have to go back to the bottom of the personal data and there will be a button that needs to be bound, otherwise it cannot be used

2. Only one of the four types of single sign-on can be enabled temporarily. If you used other single sign-on methods before and then changed to a new single Unbind (just one click) and then bind the single sign-on method you want to use now.

3. If you use **`GitHub,Microsoft,Google,DingTalk`**, you only need to fill in the client ID and secret key, and select the corresponding platform in the options.

   - If you use **`Casdoor`** the following parameters need to be filled in, just follow the tutorial to fill in

@tab Casdoor

What is `Casdoor`? Yes, you can use other OAuth applications to log in. [**Self-deployment**](https://casdoor.org/docs/basic/server-installation) is open source and free, and official hosting requires payment.

Now, Casdoor supports many OAuth application providers, as many as dozens of kinds, you have seen and not seen

**GitHub open source link: https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor**

-----

After we enter `Casdoor`, we first create **Organization**^1^, **Token**^2^, **Application**^3^, **User**^4^

Do not use the default organization (**app-built-in**) directly, because all users in this organization are global administrator accounts

Then fill in the `AList` backstage single sign-on option one by one. The user’s parameters are ignored for the time being. They are filled in when the personal data is bound to the single sign-on.

![sso](/img/advanced/casdoor.png)

After filling in the above parameters, we come to the personal data and click `Bind point single sign-on platform` to bind

Then the `Casdoor` window will pop up, we can enter our registered user name

![sso](/img/advanced/casdoor-user.png)

#### **Access some other vendors on Casdoor**

In addition to the four that `AList` has already connected to `GitHub Dingding Google Microsoft`, it is also connected to `QQ Baidu Feishu WeChat/Enterprise WeChat Douyin Bilibili` and so on, all [**click Check out all the manufacturers that can be accessed here**](https://casdoor.org/docs/provider/oauth/overview), of course, the four that `AList` has already accessed can also be added to `Casdoor`

@tab Authentik

## Authentik Setup
**Create a Provider for AList**
  1. Menu -> Applications -> Providers -> Create
  2. Select `OAuth2/OpenID Provider` and click next
  3. Enter an application name, this guide assumes you will call the provider `AList`
  4. Select your authorization flow. The built-in `default-provider-authorization-implicit-consent` is acceptable
  5. Make note of the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` fields as provided by Authentik - save these values for later
  6. For Redirect UDIs/Origins, enter the following, replacing [your.alist.domain] with the FQDN for your AList installation:
```Callback parameters
https://your.alist.domain/api/auth/sso_callback\?method=sso_get_token
https://your.alist.domain/api/auth/sso_callback\?method=get_sso_id
```
    
    Please note the \ character before ? as an escape character for the regex used for this URI is mandatory.
  7. Make note of the signing key selected as you will need it later. This guide assumes you will use the default `authentik Self-signed Certificate`
  8. Save the new provider

**Create an Application for AList**
  1. Menu -> Applications -> Application -> Create
  2. Enter an application name, recommended `AList`
  3. An application slug of `alist` will be automatically selected for you. This guide assumes you will keep this value
  4. Select the provider by name you selected in Provider Setup step 3 - `AList`
  5. Save the new application

**Retrieve the JWT certificate**
  1. Menu -> System -> Certificates
  2. Select the `>` next to the `authentik Self-signed Certificate`. If you chose another certificate for the application, select that certificate instead
  3. Click Download Certificate to get a copy of the public JWT key

## AList Setup
- **Sso login enabled:** `yes`
- **Sso login platform:** `OIDC`
- **Sso client id:** [Client ID from Authentik]
- **Sso client secret:** [Client Secret from Authentik]
- **Sso oidc username key:** `preferred_username`
- **Sso organization name:** `user`
- **Sso application name:** `user`
- **Sso endpoint name:** `https://your.authentik.domain/application/o/alist/`
  - **Note:** Replace [your.authentik.domain] with the FQDN for your Authentik installation. Mind the trailing `/` at the end of the path. If you chose a different application slug in Authentik Application setup 3, substitute that here
- **Sso jwt public key:** Open the certificate file downloaded in step 3.3 of the Authentik Application setup and paste the contents here. It will start with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`
- **Sso compatability mode:** `no`

## **SSO automatically registers as an AList account**

- ==AList Version > **v3.22.1** New Features==

Before using single sign-on to register as an AList account, we need to bind the single sign-on of AList first, the binding method is explained above

- Supports the `five` single sign-on methods mentioned above

- Do not use the default organization (**app-built-in**) directly, because all users in this organization are global administrator accounts
- Except `CASDOOR`, you only need to fill in the` Client id` and the `Client secrets`and the newly added single login account registered as Alist account configuration

<br/>



### **<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-0" style="color: #409eff;"></i>SSO Full Fill Demo**

Please refer to the detailed description below for how to fill in, the schematic diagram is just a reference for filling in and not suitable for everyone’s user habits

![](/img/advanced/sso-add.png)

<br/>



### **<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-1" style="color: #409eff;"></i>SSO auto register**

If we want SSO single sign-on to be registered as an AList account, we need to enable this option before it can be used

<br/>



### **<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-2" style="color: #409eff;"></i>SSO default dir**

That is to say, the default path used by the registered account is equivalent to the `Base path` in the AList user settings.

It can be the root directory `/`, or the path `/path/test/Demo` specified by the user

![](/img/advanced/sso-dir.png)

<br/>



### **<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-3" style="color: #409eff;"></i>SSO default permission**

It is equivalent to which permissions are enabled by default for registered users, as shown below

![](/img/advanced/sso-permission.png)

The default is 0, no permission is enabled

If we need to enable some permissions during registration, we only need the sum of the numbers of different permissions

For example：

1. We need to open the user's `WebDav reading` and `WebDav manage ` by default, that is 256+512=768, we just fill in `768` in the options
2. If we need to open the three permissions of `Make dir or upload`, `Rename` and `Delete` by default when registering, then it is 8+16+128=152, we can fill in `152` in the background

I won’t say much about the examples, just add the permissions you need

<br/>



#### **<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-4" style="color: #409eff;"></i>Precautions and instructions**

**4.1-There is already this user in the AList user database**

| username          | password | base_path | role | permission | opt_secret | github_id | disabled | sso_id      |
| ----------------- | -------- | --------- | ---- | ---------- | ---------- | --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| anyi              | FzdDfkmU | /test1    | 0    | 3          |            |           | 0        |             |
| anyi_**dc188911** | RUCtgqCw | /test1    | 0    | 3          |            |           | 0        | **dc18891** |

As shown in the above table, a string of redundant ids is added after the newly registered single sign-on user name

This is because the same user already exists in the AList user database, so the sso_id is also added after the user name

If your newly registered single sign-on user name does not exist in the AList user database, it will not add the sso_id after the name

<br/>

**4.2-What should I do if I don’t want the SSO account to be registered as an AList account?**

Just turn `SSO auto register` off,This will not affect the use of accounts that have been registered using Sso

<br/>

**4.3-If I turn off the single sign-on option, what should I do with the account registered with Sso?**

Don't worry, after using single sign-on to register and log in to AList, log in in the background, and find `personal information` after logging in

- You can modify **`username`** and **`password`** by yourself, save it after modification, so that you can log in with the AList account normally
- At this time, you can click `Unbind Single Sign-On Platform`, you can unbind or not unbind, and the subsequent [**default path**](#sso-default-dir) and [**default permissions**](#sso-default-permission) of this user can only be modified by the administrator in the AList background user

<br/>

**4.4-Why is this error code displayed when using sso?**

```json{3}
{
    "code": 400,
    "message": "The single sign on platform is not bound to any users: record not found",
    "data": null
}
```

This is because [Single Sign-On Automatic Registration](#sso-auto-register) is not enabled for the AList account, and the single sign-on cannot be registered as an AList account

- If you are an administrator, you can turn it on
- If you are a user, you can contact the administrator to enable

<br/>

## **Sso compatibility mode**

AList single -point login is bound to Dingtalk, and then opens Alist in the **`Dingtalk`** application, When you log in, choose Dingtalk login and jump to your computer browser. After authorization, you find that there is no response, because the browser cannot jump to the Dingtalk application inner browser page

At this time, you need to open the **`sso compatability mode`** again to click on the login to log in successfully

**AList applied in Dingtalk and opened as shown in the figure：**

![](/img/advanced/sso_cm.png)

<br/>

### **How to create the application in Dingtalk workbench**

A picture teaches you to create a new application and add it

- LOGO is not modified when the newly -built newly built, you can wait for the newly built and then modify ^(See_Figure_2)^ 
- If you just browse AList in the Dingtalk application, you do n’t need a single -point login management, you do n’t need to set up a single -point login configuration, you can just add an application

![](/img/advanced/sso_add_app.png)

<br/>

#### Modify the application logo

Open [**DingTalk open platform management**](https://open-dev.dingtalk.com/fe/app#/corp/app) Find your newly built app to modify the logo.

![](/img/advanced/sso_fix_logo.png)

<br/>



### **redirect url**

After turning on **`Sso compatibility mode`** Then you need to log in to the corresponding software to modify the redirect url to change it to the two redirect url below

- `GitHub` only needs to add one：`http(s)://You_Url/api/auth/sso_get_token`
- `Microsoft` and` Google` both need to be added, you can add multiple Redirect urls, so you only need to add two Redirect URLs.

```New
http(s)://You_Url/api/auth/get_sso_id
http(s)://You_Url/api/auth/sso_get_token
```

If you enable the **Sso compatibility mode** if you do not modify it, you will prompt `Invalid Redirect URL` Error
