### **Custom path**

The default installation is in `/opt/alist`. To customize the installation path, add the installation path as the second parameter, which must be an absolute path (if the path ends in alist, install directly to the given path, otherwise it will be installed in the given path alist Directory), such as installing to `/root`:

- Shut down: `systemctl stop alist`
- Status: `systemctl status alist`
- Restart: `systemctl restart alist`



## **Get Password**

You need to enter the directory folder where the script installs AList and execute the following command

#### Lower than v3.25.0

```bash
./alist admin
```


#### Higher than v3.25.0

Versions above 3.25.0 change the password to an encrypted hash value, and the password cannot be calculated directly. If the password is forgotten, it can only be re-**`randomly generated`** or **`manually set`**

```bash
# Randomly generate a password
./alist admin random
# Manually set a password, `NEW_PASSWORD` refers to the password you need to set
./alist admin set NEW_PASSWORD
```



## **What should I do if it keeps loading?**

I mounted some network disks but they cannot be used. I restarted AList and found that I could not enter. The web page prompts: `Failed to obtain settings: Please wait, storage is loading`. What should I do?

1. Wait a few minutes
2. Stop the failed/unstartable storage by using the command



:::tabs#stop
@tab Linux

If you stop by command ==You must first enter the folder where your AList is located and enter the command==

If we don’t know which storage is causing the problem, we can list all storages through the command

```bash
./alist storage list
```

```bash{1}
[root@OPSD-g8xXordx3B9f alist]# ./alist storage list
INFO[2023-11-23 17:54:10] reading config file: data/config.json

```

After entering the query command, we will enter another mode and cannot operate. If there are too many added storages, you can use the ↑ and ↓ keys on the keyboard to scroll down. After you find it, you can press `Ctrl+C` to exit.

For example, because the storage `233` cannot be loaded, we enter the command to stop it, and then restart AList.

```bash
./alist storage disable /233
```

```bash{1,5}
[root@OPSD-g8xXordx3B9f alist]# ./alist storage disable /233

@tab Mac

If you stop by command ==You must first enter the folder where your AList is located and enter the command==

Since I don’t have a Mac device at the moment, I can’t provide specific examples, but the commands are the same and you can refer to Linux and Windows.

If we don’t know which storage is causing the problem, we can list all storages through the command

List storage:

```bash
alist storage list
```

Stop storage:

```bash
alist storage disable /Path
```



@tab Docker

The `Docker` here currently only provides the default version installed using the document command. ==If you build multiple Docker versions of AList, you need to modify individual parameters~==

If we don’t know which storage is causing the problem, we can list all storages through the command

docker exec -it alist ./alist storage list

@tab Other

Basically they are the same commands, only the prefix files are different, and the commands remain the same.

List storage:

```bash
alist storage list
```

Stop storage:

```bash
alist storage disable /path
```
